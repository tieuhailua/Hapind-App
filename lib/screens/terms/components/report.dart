To make our reporting process more efficient, we need everyone to understand when you should and shouldn\'t report someone on Hapind. Our diversity is what sets us apart from other asthma apps - and we really like that. In the future, you will have the opportunity to work at different types of people from different levels. Think of us as a rapidly growing competition with new members coming from all over, like when you\'re in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. Ho Chi Minh received 1000 orchids. And often consider yourself as a responsible citizen: If that expert\'s position is not good, please speak up. You will not only protect other users from falling victim to similar acts but will also be the right hand to support us in blind spots we cannot observe. Keep your community safe by reporting violations of our Code of Conduct. Without further ado, below is what you need to know about reporting violations.'),
